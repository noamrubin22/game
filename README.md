# Mariposa

This game was my first project for the Ironhack bootcamp. It is a 'fly and jump'-game made with p5.js. The goal is to catch as many lightorbs as possible. An extra fun-aspect is added by using the p5 sound-library.

## Instructions

The butterfly is controlled by the use of sound. In the first 3 levels it responds on volume and in the last level on frequency. Each time a lightorb is collected, the player is given more time.

Have a look on this page to play it, and enjoy!
